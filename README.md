# Project Name: BPL Dream Team

## Project Description
BPL Cricket Dream Team is a web application that lets users build their dream team from the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). Users can select players based on roles, skill sets, and budget constraints, creating an ideal team that maximizes both points and balance.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React Toastify**
  
This project uses these technologies to build a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface.

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Player Selection and Pricing**: 
   Users can choose players, which updates the total price dynamically. Selecting a player will decrease the total available coins, while deleting them will refund the coins.

2. **Conditional Alerts**:
   Using React Toastify, the project alerts the user when they reach the maximum number of players or if a selected player is already chosen.

3. **Responsive Layout and Styling**:
   With Tailwind CSS, the application is fully responsive, adapting to all screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
